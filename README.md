# 📊 2-1-1 Call Data Analysis — United Way of San Antonio & Bexar County

## 📘 Project Overview  
This repository contains all scripts, cleaned datasets, spatial analyses, and visualizations created for the United Way of San Antonio & Bexar County 2-1-1 Call Data Project, as part of the **UTSA Community Innovation Scholars Program**.

The goal of this project is to analyze ZIP-level patterns of 2-1-1 caller volume and economic instability across Bexar County using spatial and statistical techniques. Key tasks include:

- Cleaning and processing 2-1-1 client and interaction call data  
- Creating ZIP-level bivariate spatial visualizations using LISA and Moran’s I  
- Analyzing the relationship between caller rates and economic instability indicators (poverty, ALICE, and combined)  
- Generating clear and digestible visuals for both technical analysis and nonprofit partner use  

This project was completed as part of a **three-person research team**. Each member was assigned a specific demographic focus.  
💼 **My assigned demographic was economic instability**, and **100% of the content in this repository directly answers the project’s research question through that lens**.  
All code, visualizations, and analysis in this repository are tied to understanding how economic instability impacts 2-1-1 caller patterns.

The repository is organized into folders by function (e.g. data cleaning scripts, LISA outputs, graphs by category) and includes both raw and filtered datasets, in addition to all exploratory and final visualizations.

## 🔍 Primary Research Question

> To what extent are 2-1-1 call patterns aligned with geographic and sociodemographic inequities in Bexar County?

We answer this through analysis of:
- Call frequency by ZIP code
- Normalized call volume (calls per 1,000 residents)
- Demographic trends of clients using 2-1-1

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, ast, plotly, scipy, etc.)
- Excel
- SPSS (for statistical analysis, not shown in this repo)
- Tableau (for final dashboard visualization)

> ⚠️ **Data files are not included in this repository due to an NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement). Only the code is available.**
